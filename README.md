# Digital Image Processing Course
Projects, activities and exercises conducted for the Introduction to Digital Image Processing class. All the material is in Spanish.

## Affiliation
Final project for the Digital Image Processing class, at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), in its ENES Morelia Campus, as part of its Bs. in Data Science career plan. 

## Grayscale Interface
A user-friendly application built with Tkinter and PIL to open, convert, and save images in grayscale, offering an intuitive interface for easy image processing. All the work is compiled in [this .ipynb notebook.]()

## Spatial Filters
This project focuses on exploring various image properties and applying spatial filters to enhance or detect features within images, utilizing techniques such as edge detection, blurring, and sharpening. All the work is compiled in [this .ipynb notebook.]()

## Image Enhancement and Edge Detection
This project involves improving image quality and detecting edges using techniques such as Gaussian smoothing, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and the Canny edge detection algorithm.All the work is compiled in [this .ipynb notebook.]()

## Affine Transformations
This project involves implementing an affine transformation, a linear mapping method that preserves points, straight lines, and planes, to manipulate images through scaling, rotation, translation, and shearing. All the work is compiled in [this .ipynb notebook.]()

## Frequency Domain Filtering
This project focuses on applying frequency domain filtering techniques to process images, which involves transforming the image into the frequency domain, applying filters to modify specific frequency components, and then transforming it back to the spatial domain. All the work is compiled in [this .ipynb notebook.]()

## Morphology and Image Segmentation
This project deals with morphological operations and image segmentation techniques to analyze and manipulate the structure of objects within an image, focusing on tasks like shape detection, boundary extraction, and separating distinct regions based on their properties. All the work is compiled in [this .ipynb notebook.]()
